 DÃ©finition => Anonymous classes enable you to declare and instantiate a class at the same time.
                                            Exemple :
    new SuperClassOrInterfaceName() {
                    1) fields
                    2) overridden methods
        };
                                                    Warning :
        An anonymous class must override all abstract methods of the superclass.
        That is, all interface methods must be overridden except default methods.

        Generally, you should consider using an anonymous class when:
           - only one instance of the class is needed
           - the class has a very short body
           - the class is used right after it's defined
