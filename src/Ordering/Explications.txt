1) To compare two strings for the less or equal relation, do it step by step:

- Compare each word letter by letter from the first position. When two letters in the same position differ, the order
of words matches the order of these letters: cord < core.

- When there are no letters left in one of the words, the prefix word is always less than or equal to the other one,
 so ball < ballet.


 2) Pour comparer les dates, on le fait étape par étape :
 Almost nothing changes when you add time to date. You compare two timestamps step by step:

 by year
 by month
 by day
 by hour
 by minute
 by second
 ...

 The ordering has several applications based on its useful properties, so, looking at this sequence, we can:

 compress the information (say, we have elements from 1 to 20)
 look for elements faster (it's easy to find elements in it and answer what elements are not present)
 analyze the structure of the data (by the glimpse we can find the minimum and maximum elements in the sequence)
 You can find applications of ordering in compression algorithms, search engines, databases, analytics tools, and many other programs.
